# Simple-Anime-List
My first CRUD code using PHP & MySQL for backend and Bootstrap 4 for frontend.

This application will help you organize any anime you've ever watched. You can add some information like cover, title, genre, and the studio made it.
This application also have login system with minimal security features. You can make new account and stay login with remember me feature.

Before use this application import database sql with name "animelist.sql" to your database
